# Linux is Badass - The Python Game
This is an interactive, text-based adventure game based on Bryan Lunduke's "Linux is Badass". Except, instead of a PDF, this is Python. Clearly. If Python isn't your style, you can still enjoy the original PDF experience on GitHub: https://github.com/BryanLunduke/LinuxIsBadass.

For more works by Bryan (and to donate some pocket change to that handsome motherf*****), visit his website at http://lunduke.com/.
