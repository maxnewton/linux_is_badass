You head straight to the Apple Store to pick up a copy of macOS, confident in your, obviously amazing, decision.

"I'd like a copy of your finest macOS," you declare, to the first Apple Store employee you find, with a ridiculous swagger that you instantly regret.

"macOS is free," says the Apple dude. "You already have it with your Mac. And updates are free now."

"But, can I buy a copy to do a fresh install?"

Turns out you can. So you do.
