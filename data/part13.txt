Your will broken and, since you are already at the Apple Store, you decide to buy a Mac. Not an expensive Mac, mind you. Just something, anything, that you can actually use to, you know, do computery things with.

After selecting the cheapest Mac money can buy (which is still about twice as much as you built your PC for), and engaging in the full contact, mixed martial arts cage match that is required in order to decline Apple Care, you slowly head home. A defeated husk of a man.

Your next few days actually go pretty well. You get your shiny, new Mac setup easily enough and things seem to mostly be working without too much hassle.

As the weeks and months roll on you become convinced that your Mac is superior hardware to all other hardware â€“ and that Mac OS is doubly superior to all other Operating Systems. This conviction quickly turns into an annoying habit where, every time a friend mentions a computer problem, you snarkily suggest getting a Mac.

You die alone. With your Mac. Because nobody likes you.

Game fucking over.
