You get home, plop yourself down at your desk, turn on the PC and stick the macOS install DVD in the drive.

And...it's...wait...something's not quite right...

About 20 reboots later you come to a pretty major decision: This isn't working. Apparently macOS doesn't like something about your PC. Huh. You'd love to do some quick research to figure out what the problem is...but, you know...no working PC.
