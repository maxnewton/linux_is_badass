OPERATING SYSTEM NOT FOUND

That's all. Just a black screen and those words, in pale white, on your gorgeous new 32" LCD screen. At least you know your newly built computer is working. The RAM check passed and, apparently, you managed to shove the CPU into the right spot. That wasn't a foregone conclusion, so you're pretty psyched about that little victory.

You fold your arms across your chest and lean back, confidently, in your chair â€“ smiling and slowly nod your head. You probably look badass right now. Like a young Charlton Heston after showing those damned dirty apes a what-for.

The smile vanishes as the meaning of those bold, all-caps words slowly dawns on you: You had forgotten to get an Operating System to put on your new, glorious tower of a computer. Luckily, there's only a few real choices, right?
