After thinking it over, you decide to put Linux on your new behemoth. Really, you wondered why you even needed to think it over. Kind of an obvious choice really. You want a fast, cool looking system. Boom. Linux. Decision made.

Only one problem. You don't actually have any way to install Linux. And, with no working PC to download Linux, the options are pretty limited. Ah, but where there's a will there's a way. You hop in the car and head down to the college.

The college, you say? Yes. The college. You see, there's two things that you can find at every college on the planet – college girls and Linux CDs.

You head to the computer science department, walk into one of the labs, and begin to say “Hey, anyone have any Linux distribution discs I can use?” but only get as far as “Hey, anyone ha” when someone shoves a DVD into your hand with a penguin drawn onto the top with a purple highlighter.

Just then a college girl strolls by. Not just any college girl...a NERDY college girl. Nay. College WOMAN. You begin to, mindlessly, move towards what, you are pretty sure, is the most amazing lady you've ever seen. She would love to go to Comic Con with you, all you need to do is ask.

Of this you are sure.

The man who gave you the Linux DVD speaks, “No, dude. Not yet. You're not ready.” You have no idea what he means by that. But he sounds like a mixture between Yoda and Ted “Theodore” Logan, so you go with it.
