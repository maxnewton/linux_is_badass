You stroll into the Apple Store and head up to the first employee you see.

“Hey, I can't seem to get macOS installed and I was hoping someone could,” you get cut off before you can finish.

“Do you have an appointment?” asks the snarky little man.

“Well. No. I really just had a quick question about which components are compatible with,” again you get cut off.

“You'll need an appointment for the Genius Bar.”

...

You have no idea how to reply to what is, without a doubt, one of the single dumbest things you have ever heard. After, what seems like, several minutes of a stupidity-induced coma, you finally manage to reply. “Soooo...”

The man points to a big screen behind the “Genius Bar” – which, and this seems worth noting, looks just like a normal counter. “Is your name on that screen?”

It isn't. But, you have an idea.

“Hey, look over there!”

You hustle over to one of the “Geniuses” and the “Bar” and quickly explain your issue before the little turd figures out your clever ruse.

“You can't install macOS on a PC! Bwahahahaha! Hey everyone! This guy is trying to use macOS on a boring old PC! Bwahahaha!” the genius laughs, the whole store joining in the gaiety.
