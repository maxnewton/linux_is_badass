Computer on. Disc in. Boots right up. Even gives the option to test drive the system before installing it. How cool is that?

So you do the “test drive” just to be sure all of your hardware works – and it does – then you proceed to install to your hard drive. While the installer copies files around you decide to take advantage of the moment to take Scruffy for a walk.

While walking in the late afternoon sun, you reflect on what a great decision you made that day. Plus you saw a hot, nerdy college girl. Yessir, life is good.

By the time you return home your system is finished installing. A quick reboot later and you've got a fully working system.

Knock, knock, knock. What's that noise, you wonder? You resolve to check into it some day.

Knock, knock, knock. What the hell is... Oh. Right.

You open the front door to find... the college girl. She smiles at you. You blurt out something along the lines of “Hi I'm door”. She holds up two tickets to Comic Con.

A man in a suit walks by on the sidewalk outside your home. He almost passes by, but then stops suddenly. “Hey! Did you just install Linux?”

“Uh-huh.”

“Well, I'm looking for a new vice president to run my video game company. Interested?”

“Uh-huh.”

“Great! You start tomorrow! But don't come to work before 10am. That's when the breakfast pizza is delivered.”

“Okay.”

The girl of your dreams turns to you. “Let's go to comic book and video game conventions together and have a very low-pressure relationship filled with lots and lots of uninhibited sex. Do you mind if I dress up like Princess Leia sometimes while we watch Star Wars in Machette Order?”

“Nope.”

THE END
