Feeling defeated -- and all alone in this cruel, cruel world -- you head back to the local Nerd Stuff to buy a new network card. This may seem like a drastic move to some, but you are a man with needs. Specifically, you need Internet access so that you can download and install updates to your new PC all night long.

"Welcome to Nerd Stuff! Anything I can help you find?" says the blue-shirted, happy man.

"I need a NIC."

"I'm sorry, what's that?"

You smile. But deep inside you want this man to die. "Ethernet card. I need an Ethernet card."

"Oh, no problem! Though you probably mean you want a wireless router"

You cut him off. "No. Ethernet card."

"Totally understand. Let me show you what we've got. Ah! Here's a great 802.11"

Again. Cut him off. Because he's an idiot. "No. Ethernet card."

"Hmm. I see. Hold one while I get someone from the computer department."

As the man heads off to find help, you finally allow yourself to breath and begin hunting for your new network card. Unfortunately there seems to be only one option. And it is the exact same card you already have. You are, needless to say, both bummed and frustrated.

Just then, inspiration strikes! You look around – like a super sneaky spy dude – to make sure nobody is looking. Then, acting as casually as possible, you pop open the box of the NIC. Which is harder to open than you'd think, what with all that tape on the end. The box now looks like it was chewed on by a Tauntaun.

What's more...no CD inside. No driver. You just molested that poor box for nothing.

You casually place it back on the rack, angled so that the "chewed on" side is less visible, and try to decide what to do next.
