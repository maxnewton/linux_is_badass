What follows is an old school, choose your own adventure style... adventure. As you read, you will be presented with choices of what to do next – and corresponding parts that you should turn to.

It's a pretty simple mechanic. If you don't get it, just pretend like you do. Or people will make fun of you on the Internet.

I should also note that there is, most definitely, a “right path” to follow in this adventure. And I think you'll be smart enough to quickly figure out what that right path is. In fact, if you follow the right path the entire adventure is pretty quick, easy and pleasant. If you deviate from that path though, shit can get bad in a hurry.
